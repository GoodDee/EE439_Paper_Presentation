# EE439_Paper_Presentation  
This repository consists of all materials I have prepared during seminar class (EE439) in semester 2, 2020. It includes presentation files, full paper, Python notebooks and R source codes. As there will be no submissions to any journals (my focus has been shifted to data science instead), I decide to make my resources to be open-sourced. Feel free to look at them as a guideline if you are taking seminar course. Feel free to reuse (and improve) my source codes (both in R and Python), but make sure that you cited this repository. I strongly discouraged plagiarism as you will learn a lot when you undertake research by yourself.
